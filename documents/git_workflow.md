# Git Workflow 
## Separate branch for each feature!
* git status

  Make sure you recognize each file
* git add --patch
 
  Make sure you made each change! 
* git commit 

  BE descriptive, VERY descriptive
* git co master
* git pull
* git co branchname

  Remember, make your branch name descriptive, too! Name it after a fix/feature!
* git push origin branchname
* Put in pull request

  Promptly follow up with a team member to review the pull request and then merge it when ready
